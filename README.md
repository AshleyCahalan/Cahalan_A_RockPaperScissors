# Rock Paper Scissors with Python
Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a vertual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: all you need is Python 3 to play.

## Usage

Clone the project, cd to your directory/download, and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for Mac/Linux, or the powershell for Windows.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cut Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapons wisely!
