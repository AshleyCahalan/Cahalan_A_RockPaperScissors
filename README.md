# Rock Paper Scissors with Python
Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: all you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) to play.

## Usage
Clone the project, <code>cd</code> to your directory/download, and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for Mac/Linux, or the Windows command prompt.

## Rules
The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cut Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapons wisely!

Built with [Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)

Enjoy!
